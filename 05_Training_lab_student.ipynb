In particular, there is a QA example where we show you how to feed your documentation into a model to ask questions about a code base. Additionally, sample code and colab notebooks are provided and linked throughout the documentation where relevant. Feedback on our documentation is greatly appreciated - we care about making LLMs - and by extension Lamini - easier to use. Please direct any feedback to support@lamini.ai.\"},{\"question\":\"What is a type system?\",\"answer\":\"The Lamini Type system is a code-first data representation library built to help users pipe data into Lamini’s LLM Engine. Lamini Types are simple, built on top of Pydantic BaseModels, and enforce strict typing so that integration into a data pipeline can run seamlessly without any errors.\"},{\"question\":\"Does the documentation provide a step-by-step tutorial for getting started with the code?\",\"answer\":\"Yes, several walkthroughs are available in the documentation. The documentation also provides links to example Google Colab notebooks which readers might run themselves and can provide a launchpad for iteration on their own data.\"},{\"question\":\"Do I have to write prompts myself?\",\"answer\":\"No, you only need to represent your data using the Lamini Type system and provide context - natural language description of each field in a Type. Lamini brings the focus of development on the data, bypassing prompt engineering as a step in language model development.\"},{\"question\":\"How do I add my data to Lamini\\'s interface\",\"answer\":\"You can quickly add data to Lamini’s interface using LLM Engine.add_data. This method allows you to make data available to the model for inference and training.\"},{\"question\":\"How do I use open model for inference\",\"answer\":\"You can use an open model by specifying the model’s name in the ‘model_name’ parameter in the LLM Engine class initializer.\"},{\"question\":\"Where do I specify model name\",\"answer\":\"You can specify model_name in both the initialization of LLM Engine or in the function LLM Engine.__call___. In other words, instances of LLM Engine are callable and configurable.\"},{\"question\":\"What does Context mean?\",\"answer\":\"Context is a natural language description of fields in each of your Types. In other words, context is metadata about your data.\"},{\"question\":\"Is it compulsory to give context?\",\"answer\":\"Context is only required for certain Type fields: str, int, bool, float, list, set, dict, and tuple. Context is not required for fields which have object types (you don’t need to add context for composed Types).\"},{\"question\":\"Is it compulsory to provide input and output types?\",\"answer\":\"Yes, in our python library, the input and output type will be used by the LLM Engine in inference. By providing input and output type, you’re defining a problem statement for the LLM.\"},{\"question\":\"How should the data be formatted in order to send it to Lamini\",\"answer\":\"You can match the type and metadata to whatever format you’d like.\"},{\"question\":\"Can I use Lamini as api instead of python library\",\"answer\":\"Yes, we have a REST API available. To see documentation go to https:\\\\/\\\\/lamini-ai.github.io\\\\/\"},{\"question\":\"How do I get api keys?\",\"answer\":\"You can generate an api key in the “API” tab at app.lamini.ai\"},{\"question\":\"Do I have to pay for using Lamini?\",\"answer\":\"Everyone starts with 10,000 free credits, which is equivalent to about $100. After that, you can purchase more credits in the “API” tab at app.lamini.ai.\"},{\"question\":\"Can I fine-tune models on my own data?\",\"answer\":\"Yes! Lamini LLM Engine has fine-tuning support. Contact us for access.  You can also look at the documentation for llm.add_data, which makes your data available to the LLM Engine.  The LLM Engine performs fast training using this data, which should complete in just a few seconds, even for large datasets.  Full fine tuning is more expensive, which is why we ask you to contact us to allocate enough compute resources to support it.\"},{\"question\":\"Are there any specific guidelines or recommendations on formatting the input data for Lamini?\",\"answer\":\"We suggest you think about language models as advanced problem solvers. Imagine you’re designing a function - what are the inputs and outputs? Lamini LLM Engine can help you build that function - but you’ll need to specify what data you have available and the format of that input data and what you wish the output was. In terms of what specific format the input data is in, Lamini Types are composable and have fields which you can mold to exactly fit your data.\"},{\"question\":\"Which models does Lamini support?\",\"answer\":\"Lamini supports every OpenAI and Hugging Face model.  For example, gpt3, chat-gpt, gpt4, pythia, gpt-neox, wizard-lm, falcon, etc.\"},{\"question\":\"Can you fine-tune an openai model?\",\"answer\":\"Yes! Lamini LLM Engine has fine-tuning support, including base models from hugging face as well as OpenAI. Contact us for access.  You can also look at the documentation for llm.add_data, which makes your data available to the LLM Engine.  The LLM Engine performs fast training using this data, which should complete in just a few seconds, even for large datasets.  Full fine tuning is more expensive, which is why we ask you to contact us to allocate enough compute resources to support it.\"},{\"question\":\"Can I fine-tune GPT 4?\",\"answer\":\"No, GPT-4 doesn\\'t support fine tuning.  However, Lamini does support fine tuning of other base models such as Pythia or other base models available on OpenAI such as GPT-3.\"},{\"question\":\"Do I need to provide data as train and test split?\",\"answer\":\"No, the LLM Engine internally uses technologies like dev sets to calibrate training.  However, as a best practice in machine learning, we recommend that you develop your own test set that you do not add to the LLM Engine, that allows you to evaluate the performance of the LLM you are building without overfitting.  A gold test set should typically include 10s to 100s of examples that are sufficiently representative of your use case and include high quality labels.  We also recommend using human evaluation to judge the performance of the language model on your test set, instead of metrics like BLEU.\"},{\"question\":\"I am running into error 500, what should I do?\",\"answer\":\"We have documentation available on how to address common errors here https:\\\\/\\\\/lamini-ai.github.io\\\\/error_handling\\\\/. Lamini’s LLM Engine is under very active development, and we thank you for using us!\"},{\"question\":\"Can I use the code documentation as a pillow for a quick nap?\",\"answer\":\"The code documentation is not meant for napping.
